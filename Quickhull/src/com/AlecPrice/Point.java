/**
 * 1.	Find the leftmost point A and rightmost point B.  Add these two points to the convex hull.
 * 2.	The line formed by these two points separate the rest of the points above and below the line.  These two sets will be processed recursively.
 * 3.	Find the point farthest from the line C and add it to the convex hull.
 * 4.	This new point will form a triangle with the previous two points.
 * 5.	You may ignore all points inside the triangle as they will not be part of the convex hull.
 * 6.	You will now have two new lines formed by AC and BC as well as a new set of points to the left and right of the triangle.
 * 7.	Repeat steps 3 â€“ 6 on these new lines and continue until no more points are left.
 * 8.	Return your convex hull.
